### Sample interview questions
- Cloudera Hadoop Yarn, Kerberos, Cell level security, Secondary indexes and troubleshooting bigdata applications.
- A file contains a billion integers, try to find any one integer that is not in the file
- Mainly focus on multi-thread and OOD, you should pay more attention on the knowledge-based question like lock, mutex and so on. You had better also have some specific knowledge to implement them in some ways.
- Multithreading operations on the binary tree.
- Algorithms and Data Structures and how to parallelize and scale algorithms to many nodes. All of them required me to code on the white board. One interviewer caught me off guard with an idiotic question on OOPS and object/class design.
- Given two arrays of unbounded length, return the sum of the minimum values of both.
- One round of design focusing on distributed systems
- Implement a system like Uber, how would architect such a system, list the components and talk about how they would interact with each other  
- Design a whole tiny url type of system (front end, back end, db, ...) 
- Design a fitness tracking application
